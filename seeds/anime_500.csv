(Source: YouTube movie - Anime History Day)The U.S. version edited and compiled the original for a reduced episode count of 276, instead of the original 291. The proper episode count was later restored on the uncut ""Orange Brick"" Season Set releases by FUNimation Entertainment released from 2006 to 2009. Additionally, the North American ""Orange Brick"" Season Sets as well as the Season Set Blu-rays crop the show from its original 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9. The only complete 4:3 release ever released in English were the Dragon Boxes which have long since gone out of print.",Spring 1989,Wednesdays at 19:00 (JST),Fuji TV,Funimation,Toei Animation,"Action, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, Martial Arts, Shounen, Super Power",24,1989
